> Undergraduate | AI / ML / DL | Generative AI & Agentic AI

I'm a **BSc Software Engineering undergraduate** deeply passionate about **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **Generative/Agentic AI**. My focus is on building intelligent systems and innovative generative models. I also enjoy **software development**, creating scalable web applications and analyzing big data with tools like MERN stack, Django, React JS, and Python. 

## üîç What I Do
- **AI/ML/DL**: Develop models using Python, PyTorch, and LightGBM for tasks like graph-based learning, recommendation systems, and predictive analytics.
- **Generative AI**: Experiment with transformers and diffusion models for tasks like text generation and creative content creation.
- **Agentic AI**: Build autonomous AI agents for decision-making and task automation using frameworks like LangChain and reinforcement learning.
- **Software Development**: Create full-stack web applications and data-driven solutions using modern frameworks and libraries.
- **Big Data**: Analyze large datasets to uncover insights using Python-based tools.

## üöÄ My Projects
- **[University Recommendation System](https://github.com/yourusername/university-recommendation-system)**: Built a LightGBM-based system to recommend university courses based on Z-scores, districts, and streams, achieving accurate ranking of eligible courses. ([Dataset on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yourdataset))
- **[GCN on OGBN-Arxiv](https://github.com/yourusername/gcn-ogbn-arxiv)**: Implemented a Graph Convolutional Network with PyTorch Geometric, achieving **0.6057 validation accuracy** on the OGBN-Arxiv dataset for node classification.
- **[Generative AI Text Generator](https://github.com/yourusername/generative-ai-text)**: Developed a text generation model using Hugging Face transformers (e.g., GPT-2) for creative writing applications.
- **[Agentic AI Task Automator](https://github.com/yourusername/agentic-ai-automator)**: Created a reinforcement learning-based AI agent to automate decision-making tasks.
- **[MERN Portfolio Website](https://github.com/yourusername/mern-portfolio)**: Built a responsive portfolio using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
- **[Big Data Analytics Dashboard](https://github.com/yourusername/big-data-dashboard)**: Developed a Python-based dashboard with Pandas and Plotly for visualizing large-scale data insights.
